1. Select dropDown = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id("billing:region_id")));
        dropDown.selectByIndex(42);

2.       UnhandledAlertException: Modal dialog present : if an alert is present on the web page and you
         try to access any of the element in the underlying page you will get this exception.

3.        //hover over Categories. Hover in multiple windows.
                 Actions act = new Actions(driver);
                 act.moveToElement(categories).moveToElement(machinery).build().perform();
                 handTools.click();
                 for (String handle : driver.getWindowHandles()) {
                     driver.switchTo().window(handle);
                 }
4.     I guess you try to back to original window using driver.switchTo().defaultContent(); ? This is not proper way.
       You should:
       store the original window at the beginning of test:
       String winHandleBefore = driver.getWindowHandle();
       click button, switch windows, do whatever
       To back to original window use:
       driver.switchTo().window(winHandleBefore);

5. For me the problem was a failing test. If you are developing in a test driven stlye than a failing / not implemented test shouldn't break the build. I still want my project to build.

   To solve this I added a configuration to surefire so that it ignores a failing test.

   <plugin>
       <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
       <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
       <version>2.19.1</version>
       <configuration>
           <testFailureIgnore>true</testFailureIgnore>
       </configuration>
   </plugin>
